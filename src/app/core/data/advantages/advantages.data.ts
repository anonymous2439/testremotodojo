    content: `It can be tough to be a startup company. They can really struggle at first, especially if they don’t have the cash to get their operations going! Of course, securing large sums of money can be really tricky, especially in a timely manner. What any smart startup founder needs is a Business Angel, or two, or three, to help them get hold of significant amounts of money when they need it the most.
    
    For instance, last year one of our startups suddenly called us for some financial aid. No small chunk of change either. With our help, they raised more than $500,000 within 3 months and the lion’s share of that was provided by Angel investors. They didn’t mess around!`

    title: "2. They can hook you up with more investors and contacts",
    content: `That’s right, a Business Angel doesn’t just throw capital at new companies, but also adds value to their business. Most Angels are seasoned investors with tons of experience in their chosen investment industries, which helps the startups when they provide contacts and guidance, growing them far faster!
    
    Another great example from our own history was in a board meeting, where we were chatting about some of the troubles faced by one of our startups. Their competitor had shot past them in revenue, while our guy kept trying to reinvent the wheel.
    
    We took him out for a beer after the meeting and suggested he look overseas for different styles of attack, but he confessed that he had no contacts in other countries and didn’t know where to turn. By the time we left the bar, our Angels had already put him in touch with two legends in his industry.
    
    Business Angels don’t only offer contacts though. You can also go to them for advice or join you in negotiations or sales pitches when you need the support of a more experienced professional. They are by your side throughout your journey because they’re the ones who invested in your startup.`

    title: "3. They aren't expecting payouts or interest",
    content: `In this case, things are quite different than from a financial institution’s perspective. Business Angels fund startups with the money they need to get going and grow. In exchange, all they want is an equity stake in the business, usually around 10%. If the startup achieves their targets, the investors get their stake. Of course, if things take longer, the Angels will wait.`

    title: "4. They're everywhere",
    content: `In Europe alone, there are a huge number of Business Angels operating, so finding them is not exactly the most difficult task. Of course, convincing them to fund your idea is a different story. Lucky for you, we know several groups of investors that meet regularly to explore newly available opportunities, both locally and regionally.
    
    We aren’t wasting time either, we’re also capitalizing in networking with these groups, and we’ll allow a startup to pitch their idea through us.`

    title: "5. They attract further investments",
    content: `Venture capitalists are always looking at startups preferred by Angels, and they know as we do that Angel investments tend to buy a new startup at least four years.
    
    That’s not all though. If a company funded by an Angel starts to take off, you’d better believe that the VCs will be sniffing around sooner or later, and that can lead to a lot more financing for the fledgling company on the rise.`

    id: 6,
    title: "6. They can give business credibility",
    content: `Like we said, Angel investors are usually some serious experts in their fields. They’ve had their successes already, which a startup can turn to their advantage. By allying with an Angel in their field, startups can build themselves a great name in the business of their choice, which only helps them grow even more.`

    id: 7,
    title: "7. They're flexible in their business decisions",
    content: `While a traditional lender can be tough with the terms and conditions, Business Angels are far less strict. The fact that it’s their own money that they’re investing also means they can be more flexible in their investment decisions, perhaps offering favorable terms to the gogetter startup.
    
    What’s more, the traditional lenders are far more likely to hear out some slightly different terms if the startup already has a sizeable investment from an Angel.`
  },
  {
    id: 8,
    title: "8. They understand the big picture",
    content: `Angel investors aren’t afraid to ‘gamble’ on a business if they like it a lot. This is because they can see how their investment might help the global and local stage adding employment opportunities and stimulating the local economies and their growth
    
    More often than not, startups and Angels stay in touch in the long term, which means they’ll be around to advise, even if they see the startup growing beyond the need for their investment. They commit!`

  {
    id: 9,
    title: "9. They often lead by example",
    content: `Business angels who’ve given back to their community, investing in the new players, can develop a positive influence on not only the startup, but other new startups that may benefit from their founders.
    
    In fact, many Business Angels were, themselves, once startup founders, who benefitted from another investor’s wisdom and guidance, so they may show the founder more opportunities to invest and build partnerships.`

  {
    id: 10,
    title: "10. They aren't afraid to take risks",
    content: `While a stake in equity might seem like a lot, remember that Business Angels are the types to take the plunge on a startup’s idea and help them to see it through. So no matter what kind of idea you might think you’ve got, and whether you’re confident or not, an Angel might see the worth in the risk and ask for equity to balance that out.`
